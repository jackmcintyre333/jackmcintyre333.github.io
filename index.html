            I am extremely passionate about creating innovative software solutions which address complex problems and improve people's lives. My primary career objective is to become an entrepreneur or software engineer. I want to obtain the skills necessary to develop and maintain reliable, efficient, and scalable software solutions. With these skills I wish to create a product either for a company or for myself that will solve a problem and improve the lives of many people. I wish to have a carear emphasized on projects that will allow me to apply the theoretical concepts I learn in class to real-world problems and develop practical solutions. Additionally, I am looking to focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analysis in working on meaningful projects that can have a significant impact on various industries. I am sincerely committed to working hard, being open-minded, staying curious, and contributing to the program and ultimately the software engineering field.
