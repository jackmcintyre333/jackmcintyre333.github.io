            <p id="paragraphTextWrap">This project is an interactive application that is aimed at helping lifters achieve their goals in the gym. It does this through a workout algorithm powered by ChatGPT that creates a workout tailored to the user's time, equipment available, and desired muscle group. It can be accessed by pulling the GitHub repository then running the steps in the README. <br></br> To view this project, click the title.</a></p>

            <p id="bottomFont">This paper details the k-means algorithm. It is a clustering algorithm that attempts to segment data into several distinct groups containing the most similar data. It uses k representative points for the data and maps the distance between those points and the data in its groups. These representative points are usually picked at random. Then, the algorithm continues to decrease the value of the distances between the mean of the points in the cluster. At this point, the algorithm outputs k clusters of data. This algorithm can be used to analyze how well NFL wide receivers performed over the 2022 season. </br > </br> To view this project, please click the title<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EyizCVHAe7M3EgvLMsMvAe87l1yrQGy2/view?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>
